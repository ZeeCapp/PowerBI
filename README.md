# PowerBI
Using this data source users are able to build reports in PowerBI using data from [eWay-CRM](https://www.eway-crm.com).

To get started you need to first create `[Documents]\Power BI Desktop\Custom Connectors` directory.

After that download the latest version of the [eWay-CRM Data Source](https://github.com/eway-crm/PowerBI/releases/latest/download/eWay-CRM.mez) into `[Documents]\Power BI Desktop\Custom Connectors` directory.

As soon as you start PowerBI Desktop you will notice a warning about **Uncertified Connectors**.

To get rid of this warning you need to modify security settings as displayed on the picture below. Go to **Security** tab in the **Options** dialog. After you apply the changes restart Power BI Desktop.
